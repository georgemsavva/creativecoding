Welcome to my Creative Coding blog.

For the past few years I've been making pretty things with code.

I've discovered a few tricks along the way, and the aim of this blog is to share these with the community.

I have learnt a lot from others blog posts, and so with this site hope to give something back.

My main language for coding is R, although I hope that the posts will be useful for those using other languages.
